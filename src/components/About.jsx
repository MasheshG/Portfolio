      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
I am currently pursuing Java Full Stack Development at JSpiders, 
Rajajinagar, Bangalore. I have a strong foundation in Core Java, 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures & Algorithms, 
SQL, DBMS, and modern frontend technologies.

I am passionate about building scalable and user-friendly web 
applications with clean architecture and efficient backend logic. 
My training has strengthened my understanding of full stack 
development including frontend design, database integration, 
and backend development using industry-standard practices.

In addition to technical skills, I possess strong problem-solving 
abilities, analytical thinking, and a continuous learning mindset. 
I enjoy working in team environments, collaborating on projects, 
and constantly improving my coding standards.

I am eager to contribute my skills to real-world projects and grow 
as a professional Full Stack Developer.
